This project is the result of writing a few applications by my small firm www.3electrons.com 

Not all of the widgets work perfectly  especially ScriptWidget and Chart widget. 
But they are quite usable. 

The test program and test_widget.ui presents the pallete of widgets. 


Any constructive criticism is welcome.


Some messages and comments are in my native language (Polish) and may
or may not change in the future.
